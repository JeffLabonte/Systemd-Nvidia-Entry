# Systemd-Nvidia-Entry
* It's started as a fork from [Grub-Nvidia-Entry](https://github.com/Superdanby/Grub-Nvidia-Entry)
* I'm trying this using Solus, but I believe that others systems can work with some tweaks.

## Prerequisites
*	Nvidia driver
*	UEFI

## Supported Operating Systems
*   Solus (tested on current kernel)
*	Maybe on Arch (but no need to execute Setup.sh, just Systemd-Nvidia-Entry.sh)

## Instructions
*   After installing Nvidia drivers, and rebooting...
*	Use Setup.sh to install the files
*	You can use Setup.sh rm to remove the stuff

## Caution
When booting, config-optimus.sh will verify whether you are using nouveau or nvidia, and while on nouveau 00-ldm.conf will be on /opt/Systemd-Nvidia-Entry/
